        <p> With the salaries of the player's being on the x-axis and the player's 2K rating on the x-axis, we see a positive linear trend in the graph. What that means is when the salary of a player rises their rating tends to rise. This shows us that salary has an impact on a player's NBA 2K20 rating. Salary of the player influences their NBA 2K20 rating.</p>

                This violin plot displays the range of the players rating according to the player's salary.  This explains the clutter on the scatter plot above. In the scatter plot we can see a clutter of points at the begining of the plot and not so much at the end of the data, this violin plot shows us why. More data is available to us with players with lower salaries because that is more common than those with extremely high salaries as we can see in this violin plot.

         This bargraph displays the average player rating for those that were taken in each round of the draft. As we can see those drafted in the first round have a higher rating than those that were taken in the second round or those that went undrafted. Draft rounds influence NBA 2K20 player ratings as we can see in this graph.

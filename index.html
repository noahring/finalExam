  <h1>NBA 2K20 Player Ratings Correlation </h1>  
    <p> The past few weeks I have studied the popular basketball video game, NBA 2K20. The game takes NBA teams and players and lets the user play with the team they decide. The players in the video game each have individual player ratings to give the user a basis on how good they actually are. This leads us to ask the question,"How does 2K come up with the player ratings for the players?" That is what I have been studying. I have developed graphs and charts to show correlations between certain things, such as salary and draft pick to come up with how 2K comes up with their player ratings. </p>
